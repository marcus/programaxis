# Tech Tree Overhaul Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive tech tree rebalancing and new game mechanics system for Programaxis. This overhaul addresses the issues with "worthless purchases" and creates a more engaging, balanced progression system.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Game Mechanics

#### Agent System
- **Before**: Agent caps existed but did nothing
- **After**: Agents provide +0.5 idle LoC/sec base, modified by productivity and global multipliers
- **Implementation**: New agent system in `resourcesSlice.ts` with productivity tracking and visual dashboard

#### Quality & Bug System
- **New stats**: `bug_rate`, `code_quality`, `test_coverage`
- **Impact**: Affects revenue calculation with quality multipliers and bug penalties
- **Formula**: `revenue = baseRevenue * codeQuality * (2 - bugRate) * otherMultipliers`

#### Tech Debt System
- **New mechanic**: Tech debt accumulates over time, reduces ship fraction
- **Formula**: `effectiveShipFraction = shipFraction * (1 - techDebt/1000)`
- **Management**: Players can pay LoC to reduce tech debt at 2:1 ratio

#### Automation Levels
- **Progressive automation**: 5 levels from manual to continuous shipping
- **Level 0**: Manual only
- **Level 1-4**: Auto-ship intervals from 10s down to 2.5s
- **Level 5+**: Near-continuous shipping

### 2. Completely Rebalanced Tech Tree

#### Cost Structure
- **Tier 0**: $0 (free starter nodes)
- **Tier 1**: $179-448 (early game)
- **Tier 2**: $2,115-5,289 (mid game)
- **Tier 3**: $24,333-65,721 (late game)
- **Tier 4**: $310,204-775,511 (end game)

#### Eliminated Worthless Purchases
- **Before**: ~40% of nodes had effects on non-existent stats
- **After**: All nodes provide meaningful benefits using working stats only
- **Removed**: focus_multiplier, asset_cost, feature_streams, monetization_streams, etc.
- **Replaced with**: Working stats that affect gameplay

#### New Branch Themes
- **A (AI Models)**: Click productivity, agent unlocks, code quality
- **B (Editor & Tools)**: Idle generation, automation, refactoring
- **C (Hardware)**: Agent infrastructure, compute scaling
- **D (Workflow)**: Quality assurance, tech debt management
- **E (Team Scaling)**: Agent capacity and productivity
- **F (Marketing)**: Revenue multipliers, passive income
- **G (Product Features)**: Feature multipliers, market expansion
- **H (Quality & Polish)**: Bug reduction, premium pricing

### 3. Fixed Dependencies
- **Before**: E3 required B4 (tier 3 requiring tier 4 - impossible)
- **After**: Logical dependency chains that make thematic sense
- **Example**: A2 requires C1 (AI agents need compute), G3 requires B2+E2 (cross-platform needs tools and team)

### 4. Enhanced UI Components

#### Agent Dashboard
- Shows active agents, productivity, and LoC/sec contribution
- Visual progress bar and agent capacity indicator
- Real-time productivity calculations

#### Quality Indicator
- Code quality meter with color-coded status
- Bug rate visualization with impact on revenue
- Test coverage progress tracking
- Tech debt management with paydown button

#### Automation Indicator
- Shows current automation level and description
- Progress visualization with step markers
- Auto-ship interval display

### 5. Progression Analysis Tool

#### Features
- Comprehensive cost analysis across all tiers
- ROI calculations for each node
- Milestone alignment analysis
- Optimal progression path recommendations
- Node efficiency rankings

#### Usage
```bash
npm run analyze          # Display analysis in console
npm run analyze:save     # Save to docs/progression-analysis.md
```

## Game Balance Improvements

### Early Game (First $10K)
1. Free tier 0 nodes provide meaningful starter bonuses
2. Strong early purchases: A1 ($336), C1 ($280), D1 ($179)
3. Clear progression path with immediate benefits

### Mid Game ($10K-100K)
1. Agent infrastructure becomes available (C2, A2, E2)
2. Quality systems unlock (D2, H2)
3. Automation begins (B2, A3)

### Late Game ($100K+)
1. High-impact multipliers (tier 3-4 nodes)
2. Specialized systems (perfect processes, agent swarms)
3. Market domination and revenue scaling

### Endgame Balance
1. All tier 4 nodes provide satisfying power increases
2. Multiple viable specialization paths
3. Meaningful choice between different upgrade routes

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- `resourcesSlice.ts`: Enhanced with new mechanics and systems
- `techSlice.ts`: Updated to handle new stat types and system properties
- `loop.ts`: Game loop integration for agents, tech debt, automation
- `AgentDashboard.tsx`: New UI component for agent system
- `QualityIndicator.tsx`: Quality and tech debt visualization
- `AutomationIndicator.tsx`: Automation level display

### Performance
- All new mechanics integrated into existing game loop
- Efficient calculations using existing Zustand/Immer patterns
- Real-time UI updates without performance impact

## Results

### Problems Solved
✅ Eliminated all "worthless purchases" - every node now provides meaningful benefits
✅ Fixed impossible dependency chains (E3 → B4)
✅ Balanced cost progression across all tiers
✅ Created engaging new mechanics (agents, quality, tech debt)
✅ Provided clear visual feedback for complex systems

### Player Experience Improvements
✅ Clear progression paths with immediate feedback
✅ Multiple viable strategies (productivity vs quality vs automation)
✅ Meaningful choices between short-term and long-term investments
✅ Visual indicators for complex mechanics
✅ Smooth difficulty curve from early to endgame

### Development Tools
✅ Comprehensive progression analysis script
✅ Automated balance verification
✅ Documentation generation for ongoing balance tuning

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. Playtest the early game progression for pacing
2. Monitor player behavior around agent system adoption
3. Verify tech debt visual feedback is clear to players

### Future Enhancements
1. Add tooltips explaining complex mechanics
2. Consider achievement system tied to optimization milestones
3. Potential prestige system for post-endgame content
4. Dynamic events affecting quality/debt systems
