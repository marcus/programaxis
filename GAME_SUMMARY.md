# Programaxis Game Summary

## Overview
Programaxis is a coding-themed idle game where players progress through a tech tree to automate and optimize their software development process. The core gameplay loop involves writing code, shipping builds, earning revenue, and purchasing tech upgrades.

## Core Mechanics

### Primary Resources
- **LoC (Lines of Code)**: Generated by clicking or idle generation
- **Revenue**: Earned by shipping code, used to purchase tech nodes
- **Tech Debt**: Accumulates over time, reduces shipping efficiency

### Primary Actions
- **Write Code**: Click to generate LoC manually
- **Ship Build**: Convert buffered LoC to revenue based on quality metrics

### Key Systems

#### Tech Tree
- 8 branches (A-H) with 5 tiers each (0-4)
- Tier 0 nodes are free, higher tiers use exponential cost curves
- Dependencies between nodes create strategic upgrade paths
- Effects include multipliers, additive bonuses, and system unlocks

#### Agent System
- Unlocked at C2 ($2,500)
- Provides passive LoC generation (0.5 LoC/sec per agent)
- Scales with agent productivity and global multipliers
- Major late-game scaling mechanism

#### Quality System
- **Bug Rate**: Affects revenue (revenue *= 2 - bug_rate)
- **Code Quality**: Direct revenue multiplier
- **Test Coverage**: Affects shipping fraction
- Creates strategic tension between speed and quality

#### Tech Debt System
- Accumulates at 0.1/sec * tech_debt_growth
- Reduces shipping fraction: (1 - techDebt/1000)
- Can be converted to LoC via refactor bonus
- Several nodes reduce or eliminate debt growth

#### Automation System
- Manual auto-ship toggle available
- Automation levels reduce shipping intervals
- Higher levels ship more frequently: 10s/(1+level)
- Reduces need for manual clicking

## Progression Strategy

### Early Game (First $10K)
1. **Tier 0 nodes** - Free base bonuses
2. **A1** ($300) - Core LoC efficiency
3. **C1** ($250) - Idle generation
4. **D1** ($280) - Quality foundation
5. **F1** ($315) - Revenue scaling
6. **B1** ($400) - Compile speed
7. **E1** ($400) - Agent preparation

### Mid Game ($10K - $100K)
1. **C2** ($2,500) - Unlock agents
2. **A2** ($3,000) - Agent foundation
3. **B2** ($4,000) - Automation
4. **E2** ($4,000) - Agent scaling
5. **D2** ($2,800) - Quality systems

### Late Game ($100K+)
Focus on tier 3-4 nodes for massive multipliers:
- Quality branch for premium pricing
- Automation for reduced manual work
- Agent scaling for productivity
- Market expansion for revenue scaling

## Recent Improvements

### Fixed Mechanics
- **Compile Speed**: Now multiplies LoC per click (was non-functional)
- **Refactor Bonus**: Functional 10% LoC boost per point
- **Bug Rate Display**: Shows "Bug-Free" percentage for clarity

### Removed Non-Functional Elements
- **Focus Multiplier**: Removed from all nodes as it was broken

### Pricing Adjustments
- **D1**: $160 → $280 (aligned with benefits)
- **D2**: $1,600 → $2,800 (10x tier scaling)

### New Systems Added
- Comprehensive agent infrastructure
- Quality/bug/debt interaction system
- Progressive automation levels
- Defensive programming for save compatibility

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Zustand store with Immer middleware
- Defensive programming with optional chaining
- Save data migration for backward compatibility

### Persistence
- IndexedDB via idb-keyval
- Autosave every 3 seconds
- Offline credit calculation
- Aggressive clear data functionality

### UI Features
- Garbled text with random intervals
- Dependency graph visualization
- Status icons (purchased/unlocked/locked)
- Real-time effect displays on tech cards

## Game Balance

### Strengths
- No "worthless purchases" - all nodes provide value
- Multiple viable progression paths
- Clear synergies between branches
- Smooth cost progression across tiers

### Areas for Monitoring
